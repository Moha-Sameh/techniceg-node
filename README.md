--> First commit

Packages used: "bcryptjs", "cookie-parser", "cors", "dotenv", "express", "express-session", "jsonwebtoken"
"passport", "passport-local", "pg", "pg-hstore", "sequelize", "sequelize-cli".

1- I used passport Authentication because it is Extremely flexible and modular.
Also it has acomprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

2- Using sequelize nowadays is the default option for most of us "programmers" as it makes it easy to manage SQL databases.
Thus, all the code will be written in javascript (typescript).

3- jsonwebtoken used to have access to the token and limit the token time and revalidate it for every request.
